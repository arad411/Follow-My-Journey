# The Very Beginning:


## March, 2018 -

In 5th grade, I barely even know what I wanted to do in the future.
After a few months of studying, the school decided to walk us once a week to the library's computers, and learn about "coding" there. Of course, this wasn't real code, but instead a few logic blocks.
Surprisingly or not, I was really good at it. Even tho my classmates weren't so interested in it, I still bypassed them all.
After this era of logic blocks ended, I finally realized what I'm actually good at, and what I want to do in the future...


## Janurary, 2020 -

This was the first ever time I encountered real code. My mom signed me up to a real-life course of basic Python, HTML, and some Linux commands.
The teacher was really nice and helped me a lot, and I actually understood what's going on.
After the course ended, I decided to continue self-studying about Website Development, and got to the point where I mastered the Frontend (not really, but that's what I've been called).
I realized that I barely make any progress, any left all of my projects behind.


## September, 2023 -

After I got back to school, I remembered what I left behind - some old, really boring, and mostly unfinished projects of pure HTML and CSS.
Once launching my beloved Visual Studio Code, I quickly regained my memory about how to do stuff, and wanted to learn more.
I began exploring, mostly about HTML or CSS, but also a bit of JavaScript, until I couldn't study anymore.
But short after, I saw that I barely make any progress (once again), and quickly abondanded it.


# The beginning of a new start -


## May, 2024 -

When school began to fade, and I had less homework to do, I wanted to come back to do what I like the most - coding.
In this era, Artificial Intelligence began to spread, so I had someone to discuss with, since I didn't have any friends or family members who were into coding.
After some chatting, I began to explore more about "real coding" (backend, python, SQL, and cybersecurity).


## June, 2025 -

At this point, even though I didn't have much experience, I began programming some random stuff in python - Snake, Discord Bots, Calculator, AutoClicker, CookieClicker, and more.
As much as I would liked to, I couldn't sell any of my work, since it was too bad (some people might buy it, but for a price too low to be worth the effort).
I began exploring more about "real stuff", like cybersecurity and things that I could actually work as in the future.

## October, 2025 (Present) -

Currently, I study about basic Databases, Backend, Cybersecurity, and Python (in general).
I will (hopefully) update this file once something more interesting will happen
